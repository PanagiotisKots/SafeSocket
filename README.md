<h2>#SafeSocket++</h2> is a console-based program (for now), fully developed in C++ for networking and user communication. It is designed to facilitate communication between computers 
on the same local network using socket technology. It includes a server and client structure, allowing a client to connect to the server and 
enable full communication between two or more computers through a predefined port and IP.
